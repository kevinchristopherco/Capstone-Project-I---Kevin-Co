   <h2>Baked Potato Wedges with Cheese Sauce(Attempt #1)

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>524 g regular potatoes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>5 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
      <li>0.240 kg  Feta cheese </li>
      <li>5 tablespoons salted butter (Magnolia Butter)</li>
      <li>1 cup evaporated milk (Alaska Evaporated Filled Milk)</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour (Magnolia All Purpose)</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
   
   <h3>Procedure</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>The potatoes were cut into wedges.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt1/1.1.jpg" alt="step 1">
     

      <li>I drizzled vegetable oil over the wedges. </li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt1/2.1.jpg" alt="step 2">
 

      <li>I roasted the potato wedges in 2 batches based on the assigned baking durations under 175 degrees Celsius and there were 15 wedges of potato per batch: .</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Batch #1 – 14:00 minutes </li>
            <li>Batch #2 – 12:00 minutes </li>
         </ul>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt1/3.1.jpg" alt="step 3">
 

      <li>After baking, the potato wedges were placed on tissue paper to drain the oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt1/4.1.jpg" alt="step 4">
 

      <li>For the white cheese sauce, the butter was first melted in a medium sauce pan on low heat. Flour was added ¼ cup at a time to make a roux. The roux was cooked for 2:00 minutes while stirring. </li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt1/5.1.jpg" alt="step 5">


      <li>Later I added the milk ¼ cup at a time, whisking continuously with an egg beater for the mixture to blend and thicken. Then I last added the feta cheese and continued to stir the mixture until the cheese melted. </li>

   </ol>

   <h3>Feedback</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Texture: Sauce is really thick and lumpy due to too much flour added</li>
      <li>Taste/Flavor: Batch A was less cooked on the outside due to lack of vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>Appearance: Feta Cheese did not fully melt in the béchamel sauce</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>

   <h3>Recommendations</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Use Quick Melt Cheese instead of Feta for the cheese sauce</li>
      <li>Use less flour for the cheese sauce</li>
      <li>Grease baking tray with vegetable oil before placing the potato wedges from Batch A.</li>
      <li>Season potato wedges from Batch A, B with pepper asides from salt</li>
      <li>Potatoes should be baked for a certain number of minutes and then flipped over before being baked again.</li>
      <li>Reduce to 3 tablespoons All Purpose Flour</li>
   </ul>
