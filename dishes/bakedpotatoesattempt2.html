   <h3>Procedure</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>The potatoes were peeled and sliced to wedges with a stainless steel knife. Batch C was sliced in half lengthways then in thirds on a 60 degree angle. The potato wedges were then washed with water in a bowl and left to dry for a few minutes.</li>
      
      <p>Weight of Potatoes before peeling:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Potato A: 201 g</li>
         <li>Potato B: 193 g</li>
         <li>Potato C: 238 g</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weight of Potatoes before peeling:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Potato A: 194 g, 16 wedges</li>
         <li>Potato B: 187 g, 12 wedges</li>
         <li>Potato C: 225 g, 16 wedges</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt2/1.1.jpg" alt="step 1">
     

      <li>I mixed the potato wedges with vegetable oil by hand in the bowl, 2 tablespoons per batch.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt2/2.1.jpg" alt="step 2">
 

      <li>I roasted the potato wedges in 3 batches based on the assigned baking durations under 175 degrees Celsius and there were 15 wedges of potato per batch:  .</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Batch A – 10:00 minutes, flipped over, then cooked for another 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Batch B – 12:00 minutes, flipped over, then cooked for another 12 minutes</li>
            <li>Batch C – 14:00 minutes, flipped over, then cooked for another 14 minutes</li>
         </ul>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt2/3.1.jpg" alt="step 3">
 

      <li>After baking, the potato wedges were taken off the tray with a metal spoon and placed on a plate with tissue paper to drain the oil. I  seasoned the baked potato wedges with salt. Then using a pepper mill grinder, I went around the plates containing the potato wedges while turning the knob to season.
</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt2/4.1.jpg" alt="step 4">
 

      <li>For the white cheese sauce, the butter was first melted in a medium sauce pan on low heat. Flour was added ¼ cup at a time to make a roux.  </li>
      <img src="./images/bakedpotatoesattempt2/5.1.jpg" alt="step 5">


      <li>Later I added the milk ¼ cup at a time, whisking continuously with an egg beater for the mixture to blend and thicken. Then I last added the Quickmelt cheese and continued to stir the mixture until about 4:30 minutes passed.</li>

   </ol>

   <h3>Feedback</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Texture: Batch B is the most preferred over A and C because the potato wedges were crispy on the outside and had enough moisture in the sense that they were not dry in the inside. Cheese sauce is less thick not and is more smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Taste/Flavor: Cheese flavor could be made a little stronger</li>
      <li>Appearance: Batch B potato wedges had enough potato in the inside and were very fluffy.</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>

   <h3>Recommendations</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>For the cheese sauce, check other types of cheese or add more cheese next time</li>
      <li>The 60 degree cutting scheme on potatoes can be maintained</li>
      <li>Lessen the potato wedges to two batches on the next attempt</li>
      <li>Research on how to maintain moisture inside the potato wedges when taken out of the oven.</li>
   </ul>
