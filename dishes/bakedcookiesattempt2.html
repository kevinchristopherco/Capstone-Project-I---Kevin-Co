      <li>1 teaspoon. baking soda (Arm & Hammer Pure Baking Soda)</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon iodized fine salt (McCormick Iodized Salt)</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
   
   <h3>Procedure</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>The butter and sugar, both at room temperature, were first mixed together until they became light and fluffy using white plastic spatula. </li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/1.1.jpg" alt="step 1"><br>

      <li>The eggs, the vanilla extract and the corn syrup were then added to the butter- sugar mixture until well-blended.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/2.1.jpg" alt="step 2"><br>

      <li>The flour, baking soda, baking powder were all sifted using a strainer. On a separate bowl, the dry ingredients were combined together: flour, oatmeal, cinnamon powder, baking soda, baking powder, fine salt.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/3.1.jpg" alt="step 3"><br>

      <li>Afterwards, the wet and dry ingredients were combined and mixed until the new mixture became doughy.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/4.1.jpg" alt="step 4"><br>

      <li>For the coating, the cacao tablets were melted in hot cream for 20 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius until the texture became brownish liquid. The liquid was placed on a small bowl. The marshmallows were sliced to small bits and added to the cacao liquid and the bowl was stored in the refrigerator for cooling.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/5.1.jpg" alt="step 5"><br>

      <li>The dough mixture was molded into small circular shaped pieces using an ice cream scooper.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/6.1.jpg" alt="step 6"><br>

      <li>2 sheets of non-stick wax paper were placed on 2 metal baking trays. Salted butter was brushed on the baking trays so that the cookie batter would not stick.</li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/7.1.jpg" alt="step 7"><br>

      <li>The cookies were baked in batches of 2 with 12 cookies per batch. Batch 1 was baked for 14:30 minutes while Batch 2 was baked for 15:00 minutes. </li>
      <img src="./images/bakedcookiesattempt2/8.1.jpg" alt="step 8"><br>

      <li>Each baked cookie was dipped into the bowl containing the cacao and marshmallows to give it a glazed look and was stored in the refrigerator so that the melted cacao marshmallow mixture coating would solidify. </li>

   <h3>Feedback</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Texture - soft/high moisture content so difficult to handle and pack. </li>
      <li>Taste and Flavor - almost perfect balance.</li>
      <li>Appearance - still not very appealing as the cookies appear too wet</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>

   <h3>Recommendations</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Cookies can be baked in four batches. Each batch of cookies will have a different baking time. </li>
      <li>It is better to take a tablespoon of cacao mixture and spread it on a plate. Then a cookie can be mopped on the mixture to make it less wet. Perhaps a set of cookies can receive a full coating and other set can receive a full coating of the cacao mixture.</li>
      <li>To have a better tasting of the cacao mixture, it can be melted on 500 ml of cream instead of 700 ml.</li>
   </ul>
